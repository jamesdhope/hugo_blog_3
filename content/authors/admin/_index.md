#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I'm an experienced technical architect and engineer in the IBM Technology, Client Engineering Team. I lead multidisciplinary engineering teams in the design and build of next generation data & AI, automation, integration and hybrid cloud technologies. I sit on the British Standards Institute (BSI) ART/1 Artificial Intelligence Committee, a mirror committee for the international ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 and European CEN/JTC 21 committees, contributing to the development of AI standards as a national expert. I also sit on the Ecosystems Architecture and AI Working Groups at The Open Group contributing to standards for professional practice. I have been a member of the University of London Data Science MSc academic tutor team teaching AI and Machine Learning. I am an IBM Certified Architect, IBM Certified AI Engineer, GCP Professional Cloud Architect, GCP Professional Machine Learning Engineer and certified in Data Science and Machine Learning (HarvardX). I am a Certified Information Systems Security Practitioner (CISSP, ISC2) and certified in Red Hat Openshift. I graduated with First Class honours in Computer Science and hold a Masters degree from Cambridge University. I post here mostly about architectural patterns and engineering exploits that I am able to talk about.
