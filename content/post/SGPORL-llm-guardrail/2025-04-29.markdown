## Why a New Approach?

Enterprises deploying language models often face the same challenge: how to ensure responses stay *on topic*, *coherent*, and *aligned with business goals*—without drowning in prompt engineering or moderation scripts.

Traditional alignment tools like hardcoded filters or post-hoc similarity scoring aren’t enough. And RLHF, while powerful, is resource-heavy and opaque.

What if your model could *learn* to stay aligned—by following a **semantic roadmap** of your domain?

That’s exactly what this project enables: training LLMs to **follow paths through a semantic graph**, where *trajectories of language* are reinforced when they reflect valid, meaningful transitions between enterprise-relevant concepts.

## The Architecture: Language as Graph Traversal

At the heart of the system is a **frozen base LLM** (e.g. Qwen-7B), with a **small policy head** trained via reinforcement learning. The novelty isn’t just the model—but how it learns:

- **State**: The prompt and its evolving semantic context.
- **Action**: A generated sentence or chunk from the LLM.
- **Reward**: A scalar signal based on how well the response *traverses* a semantic knowledge graph.

### What is the Semantic Graph?

The graph consists of curated domain topics as nodes (e.g. "AI Ethics", "Bias", "Regulation") and meaningful topic transitions as edges. This structure defines what “on-topic” and “coherent” look like for your enterprise.

For example: "AI Ethics" → "Bias" → "Auditability" is a valid, rewardable trajectory. But: "AI Ethics" → "Super Bowl halftime show" is not.

## How the Graph Guides Rewards

Each response is broken into sentences or chunks and embedded via a sentence transformer. These embeddings are mapped to the closest nodes in the semantic graph. We then observe the **trajectory** the response takes across nodes.

The **reward function** evaluates:

- **Transition Validity**: Each node-to-node step is checked against the graph. Valid transitions get a positive reward (+1), while incoherent or off-graph transitions receive 0 or negative reward.
- **Trajectory Score**: The sum of rewards across the full path defines the episode's reward.
- **Prompt Coherence**: An additional term measuring how semantically close the response is to the original prompt.

Together:

```python
reward = 0.7 * trajectory_score + 0.3 * coherence_score
```

This encourages not just individual good responses—but flows of thought that walk a meaningful path through your knowledge domain.

Reinforcement Learning Loop

We treat generation as an RL problem:

- Policy: A small head on top of a frozen LLM.
- Environment: Prompts sampled from enterprise data.
- Trajectory: The response path through the semantic graph.
- Gradient Updates: Log probabilities and rewards from sampled episodes are used to update the policy.

Over time, the LLM learns to produce responses that not only answer well—but navigate your knowledge graph coherently.

## Why It Matters for Enterprises

This approach is built for practical alignment:

- Transparent: You define the graph—your domain, your policies.
- Composable: Update the graph as your knowledge evolves.
- Modular: Integrates with existing LLMs; no need to retrain the base model.
- Low Overhead: The policy head is lightweight and efficient to train.

This is more than a chatbot fix—it’s a scalable framework for enterprise AI that speaks your language, literally and structurally.

## Sample Use Case: AI Compliance Chatbot

Imagine a compliance assistant that:
- Must stay within risk, ethics, and regulatory domains.
- Must reason across topics without hallucination.
- Must avoid wandering into irrelevant or sensitive territory.

Using a semantic graph of these compliance concepts, the model learns to reward paths that flow through valid policy chains—and penalize digressions—all through reinforcement on response trajectories.

## Codebase Overview

- SemanticGraph: Defines the nodes (topics) and valid edges (transitions).
- TopicMapper: Maps LLM outputs to graph nodes via embeddings.
- RewardEngine: Scores transitions and coherence to produce scalar rewards.
- TrajectorySampler: Tracks node paths during generation.
- RLTrainer: Runs policy gradient updates using logged trajectories and rewards.

It’s alignment through structure. And structure through language.

## Final Thoughts

This isn't about smarter LLMs—it’s about better-aligned ones.

By treating semantic navigation as a reinforcement learning task, we gain controllability, interpretability, and adaptivity—without needing armies of annotators or endless prompt tuning.
